# ReMa

**Career UI Harness**: a fast, lightweight desktop app built on a deterministic Rust core with an embedded LLM layer.

Rust owns application state, persistence, scheduling, validation, provider configuration and execution. LLMs are used only to reason about prompts and write the responses.

## What V1 does

- **Chat**: a general-purpose AI chat with streaming responses, Stop, Retry, Copy, Markdown (code, lists, tables, links) and persistent conversation history ("Recents").
- **Models**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, …). Pick the model in the chat composer.
- **Scheduled Tasks**: schedule the prompt you are writing, straight from the composer. Supports one-time, daily, every N days, selected weekdays, and intervals of 15 minutes or more. A task can end on a date or after N runs. You can edit, pause, resume, delete or run tasks now, and each task keeps its run history with results.
- **Settings**: connect providers, choose which models appear in the chat, and set the default model.

## Architecture

```text
React components            src/pages, src/components
      ↓
Hooks / frontend services   src/hooks, src/services
      ↓
Generated typed IPC         src/generated/bindings.ts (from Rust, via tauri-specta)
      ↓
Thin Tauri commands         src-tauri/src/commands
      ↓
Rust services               src-tauri/src/services   (chat, providers, tasks, scheduler, schedule)
      ↓
Persistence / providers     src-tauri/src/db (SQLite) · src-tauri/src/llm (adapters) · src-tauri/src/secrets (OS keychain)
```

Rules:

- **Deterministic core.** The scheduler decides when tasks run, using pure, unit-tested schedule math. The LLM never controls timing, state, credentials or configuration.
- **Provider-neutral.** Chat and scheduler use one `LanguageModel` interface. Provider request formats, authentication, streaming and errors stay inside `llm/openai.rs`, `llm/anthropic.rs` and `llm/gemini.rs`. The OpenAI adapter also serves every OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
- **Rust is the source of truth.** IPC types, commands and events are generated from Rust. The frontend never hand-writes copies of them.
- **Streaming via events.** Replies stream as typed `ChatEvent`s. Generation runs in the background, so switching chats does not interrupt it.

## Data and credentials

- **Database**: SQLite at `<app data dir>/rema.db`. On macOS that is `~/Library/Application Support/cloud.datasound.rema/`. Schema changes are versioned migrations in `src-tauri/src/db/migrations/`.
- **Credentials**: API keys are stored in the operating system's credential store: macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, or Secret Service on Linux. They never go in the database, config files or the frontend. The UI can only save, replace or remove a key.
- **Authentication**: API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic and Gemini. OpenAI-compatible endpoints take an optional key. None of the three cloud providers offers an official OAuth flow that a third-party desktop app can use for their model APIs without its own registered OAuth client. The credential model already supports OAuth tokens (with expiry), so an official flow can be added without changing chat or scheduler code.

## Scheduler behaviour

- Tasks run only while ReMa is open. If ReMa was closed through one or more scheduled times, the task runs **once** at the next start and then continues on schedule.
- A run is claimed and the schedule advanced *before* it starts, so it can never run twice. A task that is still running skips its next occurrence.
- "Run now" does not change the schedule or count toward "stop after N runs".
- Daily and weekly schedules keep wall-clock time in the task's timezone, including across daylight-saving changes. Intervals are exact durations.
- The 15-minute minimum is enforced in Rust (the frontend only mirrors it).
- Each run is limited to 15 minutes. Failures are recorded in the history without breaking the task.

## Prerequisites

- **Rust** (stable, 1.88+): <https://rustup.rs>
- **Node.js** 20.19+ or 22.12+
- **pnpm** 10: `corepack enable`
- **Platform dependencies for Tauri**: <https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/>
  - macOS: Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`)
  - Linux (Debian/Ubuntu): `sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev build-essential curl wget file libxdo-dev libssl-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev` plus a Secret Service provider (for example GNOME Keyring or KWallet) for API keys.

## Getting started

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm tauri dev      # launches the desktop app with hot reload
```

Then open **Settings**, connect a provider (or add an OpenAI-compatible endpoint such as `http://localhost:11434/v1` for Ollama), and start chatting.

## Adding a backend command

1. Add types to `src-tauri/src/models/` (derive `Serialize` and `specta::Type`) and logic to `src-tauri/src/services/`, with tests.
2. Add a thin `async` command in `src-tauri/src/commands/` (`#[tauri::command]` + `#[specta::specta]`, returning `AppResult<T>`).
3. Register it in `collect_commands![...]` in `src-tauri/src/ipc.rs`, then run `pnpm bindings`.
4. Wrap it in a frontend service (`callBackend(() => commands.myCommand(...))`) and use it from a hook.

## Window chrome

On macOS the window uses Tauri's overlay title bar, so the traffic lights sit inside ReMa's header. The header is the window drag area; buttons placed in it stay clickable. Windows and Linux keep their native title bars.

## Styling

All colors, type, spacing, radii and shadows are CSS custom properties in `src/styles/tokens.css`. The palette uses LinkedIn-style blue (`#0A66C2`), white, soft gray and dark text, with subtle borders and restrained shadows.
